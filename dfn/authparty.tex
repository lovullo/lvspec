\label{s:authorize}

This specification is currently a draft and requires that each requirement be
verified and authorized for development.

An authorization indicates that a member of the indicated party or parties with
sufficient knowledge on topic affirms that the requirement is---to the best of
his or her knowledge---accurate and suitable for incorporation into an
implementation of the specification.

\p{signcomp} A signature line next to content that is not a numbered paragraph
is a \dfn{significant component}.

\begin{ex}
  \signline
  This example is not a paragraph but still contains a signature line; it is
  therefore a significant component under the definition of \pref{signcomp}.
\end{ex}

Each paragraph and significant component of the specification, unless incomplete
or previously authorized, contains a line that may be used for the initials of a
member of the party indicated in parenthesis. If multiple parties are
applicable, they will be separated with slashes.

Only a member of the party knowledgeable on the topic \shall provide their
authorization.

An authorization is performed by (a)~signing one's initials on the provided line
or (b)~indicating the paragraph number (or, for significant components, an
appropriate notation containing at least the section number and a unique
identifier for the significant component itself) via some \unspecified\ method
of correspondence that explicitly indicates each and every individual
authorization.

A particular authorization is valid until the authorized paragraph or significant
component is modified from its authorized form.

Signature lines with no authorization party listed \shallnot be authorized until
at least one party has been chosen.
